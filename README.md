# Collaboration Best Practices

This repo contains guidelines and tips for effective collaboration and project management among developers. It covers communication, presentation, tools, exception handling, actions pushback, and naming conventions.

The goal of this repo is to help developers work together more efficiently and productively, as well as to improve the quality and consistency of their code.

## Objective

Ensure best practices for collaboration.

## Key Results

- Create a WhatsApp group for communication.
- Implement 2 min, 5 min, and 10 min pitches for development work presentations.

## Tools

- Use standard frameworks/tools with stated purposes in the Readme.md.
- Python developers should use Collab for components.
- For JavaScript, use Eslint; for Python, use Pylint.

## Exception Handling

- Write custom exceptions for code errors within functions.
- Create exceptions for third-party APIs, print "Come back later" for unresponsive APIs.

## Actions Pushback

- Utilize pull requests to add code.
- If pull request actions fail, create an issue in the repo and email the developer.

## Naming Conventions & Code Practices

- Use consistent port numbers during project presentations.
- Follow established file structure practices, like "src" for source files.
